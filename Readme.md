###  Most Important Features in this project
1. If you click on the campaign card then you can see the details of that card. I first created a dynamic path, then linked the card to that dynamic path. And I have done all the rest of the data loading

2. If you click on the donation button, it will go to the donation page and it will be added. Basically, first I clicked on the button, then I set it to local storage and loaded the data by accessing it on the donation page.

3. All donations can be seen on the donation page. By default the bat will show the data 4th and if it is more than then show all button will come and if you click it it will show all donation data. If someone wants to add data in one way then they can't because it will give an alert that you can't add data in one way.
